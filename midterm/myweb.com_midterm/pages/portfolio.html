            Growing up, I've learned that basketball played a big role in my life. Throughout time and conversations with my mother, I've realized it was a big part of my family's life as well. As a younger girl, my mother used to play on a basketball team as well as my older brother did.

        <center>I used to play center throughout every basketball game.</center><center>There were moments throughout each game that were beyond tense whenever the ball was in your possession. </center>
        
   <center>Though majority of the time our games and practices were after school, I would go out even on weekends and summers spending time on any court.</center>

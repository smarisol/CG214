     <center><h1>Summer Sixteen'</h1></center>
        <p>
            My Summer Sixteen did not go as planned. Though I failed to leave the state or country, I stayed in New York and was able to take adantage of attending galleries and opening events from other local fine artist. I was able to network with an artits from brooklyn who happens to have a showcase coming soon. Also, throughout the summer, I've spend long summer nights lounging with my boyfriend around the city, queens and brooklyn. He carries a <b>passion</b> for DJing and so had many events throughout the summer break.  
        </p>
        
        
        
   My ideal summer sixteen would be to travel outside the country to new places I've never visited before. Ideal places would have been:<li>1. Belize</li>
        <li>2. Guatemala</li>
    <li>3. Greece</li> <li>4. Aruba</li>
        
        <p>Throughout Summer Sixteen', I took the advantage and painted day and night for some time and was able to complete a painting and sell it to a <i>faithful</i> supportor. </p>
    
        <center>My boyfriend and I explore the city as well. He brought me to this old fashioned deli called The Katz.</center><center>The location on the map is down below.</center>

    Throughout the last couple of weeks, I've been exploring places, meeting people and learning a lot through it all. Two weeks ago I went camping for the very first time with a couple of close friends. Here are some images and videos..

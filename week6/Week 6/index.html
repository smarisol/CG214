    <center><h1>MIDTERM PROJECT</h1></center>
    
      For my midterm project, I'll be doing a blog website dedicating to something I love. There are many ideas and different ways I'd like to go about my blog and what I would love to speak upon. For my first page of the blog, I'd love to speak about a couple of sports that I've been interested in since I was in junior high school. I've played numerous of sports like soccer and basketball. I used to play tennis for a short period of time but the sport itself didn't catch my attention as much. I will also be informing you about my experiences with each sport and how I dragged it out throughout my later years. 
 <br> <br>      For the second page, I will be talking about my favorite and least favorite teams that refer to the sport itself. The feeling I would receive while playing the sport or watching others play. The physically feeling or mental reactions I would experience. I would also like to speak upon how the sport was structured.
